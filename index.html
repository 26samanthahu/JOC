	<p> I am a freshman at Piedmont High School. I have two sisters. I enjoy playing tennis, baking, traveling, and spending time with friends and family. This site will highlight the projects I have made in the Joy of Computing class as well as other experiences I have had during the 2022-23 school year.</p>
